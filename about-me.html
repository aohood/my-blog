      <h2 >Who is Aya?</h2>
      <p class="regular">My name is Aya, I was born on August 23rd, 1990 in Gaza Strip - Palestine.
        I am a wife, a mom, a compouter Engineer and a blogger.</p>


      <h2>Passion:</h2>
      <p class="regular">for 6 years in the US, i have been strugilling trying to survive noT bEing able to work or to study because of my visa,
        but it turned out that waiting won't fix any issues, the only thing to accieve what I want is me working on myself trying not to lose it.
        And here I am, learning programming all over again, rebuild the engineer I like inside me.
      </p>

      <h2>Intrests and Hobbies:</h2>
      <p class="regular">Learning new stuff has been always attractive for me, recentely I learnt that I can be a good artist whenever I hold the board and the colors.
        I know that I am a good writer, at least in my native language.
        trying to relearn programming again feels like getting back a lost piece of me, I am so intrested in building new skills in the field too.
        So, here are my hobbies:
          <ul>
            <li>Painting</li>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>crafting</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>

          </ul>
